> [!WARNING]
> This configuration is made by myself, for myself, and with very little concern for
other's preferences. This configuration is not meant to be "good", it's just meant to be
comfortable for me. Let it also be known that this is *VERY* WIP and I'm no Lua or nvim
expert.

# gwostwriter
My personal Neovim configuration, meant to be simple, quick and have zero relationship
whatsoever with Nerd Fonts.

## Characteristics
- Clean and simple UI that stays out of way and looks elegant.
- No dependency on icon fonts, use whatever font you want (though you probably still want
it to be a mono font).
- Easy addition of your own plugins and colorschemes.

## Features
- Statusline, tabline and file tree with elegant looking configurations.
- LSP and completions.
- Git signs.
- File searching.

## Showcase
**TODO**

# Installation
Installation is fairly simple, just make sure the nvim configuration path exists and run
```
# $CONFIG_PATH varies depending on your OS, on Linux it's most commonly `~/.config/nvim`.
git clone https://github.com/gwynsav/gwostwrite.git $CONFIG_PATH
```

# Acknowledgments
Thanks to [Vimjoyer](https://github.com/vimjoyer), the initial structure of this
configuration was based off his [starter guide](https://github.com/vimjoyer/nvim-video).
